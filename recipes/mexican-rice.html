<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil in the pot. Add chicken and saute until edges are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Cancel Saute mode and transfer chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot; scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits with a spoon. Add corn, black beans, diced tomatoes with green chilies and their juices, rice, seasoning salt, chili powder, and garlic powder. Place chicken pieces on top of rice mixture.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 1 more minute. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Open the lid and stir chicken and rice. Serve in bowls topped with shredded Mexican cheese and chopped cilantro.</li>
